# virtualmin-nginx-config-hook

A [Virtualmin](https://www.virtualmin.com/) hook to generate a nginx server config file post-Apache server setup.

## Why?

- [x] You have a dedicated server or a VPS
- [x] You have a LAMP stack beautifully set up and configured
- [x] You use Virtualmin as the web hosting control panel of choice
- [x] You have Apache proxied by a public-facing nginx, because performance
- [x] You have to manually create and manage those nginx `.conf` files after setting up a host in Virtualmin, and
- [x] You ~~are too lazy for this shit~~ feel like your time can be used for something better

## How?
Virtualmin can be configured to run a command (_hook_) before and after making changes to a server. In the command context, a lot of global variables are pre-populated by Virtualmin, ready to use. For example:

```bash
uid=500
name=1
postgres=0
web_port=8000
limit_mysql=1
limit_ssl=0
```

Take a look at `sample-dom-file` for a more complete example. 

All of these variable names will be available with a `$VIRTUALSERVER_` prefix, e.g. `$VIRTUALSERVER_UID`, `$VIRTUALSERVER_DOM` etc. Making use of them, we can write a shellscript to automate creating and managing the nginx config files on the fly.

## No, really, how?
Oh ok...

```bash
git clone git@github.com:phanan/virtualmin-nginx-config-hook.git
chmod +x virtualmin-nginx-config-hook/hook
```

Then, [configure the post domain modification script](https://www.virtualmin.com/documentation/developer/prepost) to point to `hook`'s full path. Now whenever you create or modify a (sub)domain via Virtualmin interface, these things should happen, in that order:

1. A file in the format of `{domain_name}.conf` is generated under `{nginx_conf_dir}/sites-available`
1. A symbolic link pointing to said file is created under `{nginx_conf_dir}/sites-enabled`
1. `nginx` service is then reloaded and ready to serve

When you delete the (sub)domain, both the file and its symlink are removed.

## Configuration
The hook works with the assumption that your nginx is configured to read domain config files from `sites-enabled` and `sites-available` directories, following the (arguably) [most common practice](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-the-nginx-web-server-on-a-virtual-private-server). Additionally, these variables can be configured to fit your needs:

```bash
NGINX_CONF_DIR="/etc/nginx"
NGINX_PORT=80
NGINX_SSL_PORT=443
```

Other than that... not so much, sorry.

## Known Limitations
* Upon Virtualmin domain update, the corresponding `.conf` file's content will be completely reset. If you have any custom modifications, they will be gone into oblivion
* Domain disabling and re-enabling are not supported yet.
